## Jan 23 2020
Operators 
===      //  is it the same  cat ===cat
!==       //  ‘Chris’ !== ‘Bob’ 

Boolan = True / False 
String = Text 

FreeCodeCamp worked on JavaScript learnt about assignment operators https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Assignment_Operators

Watched colour theory + Fonts
Monochromatic colours - very contemporary
Tri attric colour - very balanced (very 90s)
Analogous colours (adjacent on colour wheel) - very harmonious and easy to read 
Complementary colours - opposite on wheel ( attention grabbing )
Split colours - across and then take the 2 adjacent colours (attention grabbing but more complementary)

Resources 
Flatuicolors.com (good iOS colors)
Material palette.com (Android colors)
Colorzilla browser extension

Humanist fonts are better for readability
Mix serif with sans-serif (body seirf ; heading sans serif) - don't mix same type or use more than 3 different types of fonts, will become cluttered.
